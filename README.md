# Project: WolfRayet
### TYPE | Ray Tracer (CPU -> GPU)
---
A C++ application that uses ImGUI, GLFW and OpenGL/Vulkan to display a 2D texture generated by casting rays into a scene and coloring a texture based on those collisions with sceen objects. 

At first, all computations will be done on the CPU, with the results transferred to a texture that ImGUI displays to the screen, but eventually I have plans to move the entire process to the GPU with (probably) Vulkan. 

For the intial setup, we're using OpenGL since we won't actually be using a graphic API yet, but ImGUI needs one for it to render its panels.

## Previous Project's Learning Outcomes (Reach - PBR Renderer)
- The distinction between Renderer and RenderAPI is a bit unnecessary - maybe combine them for smaller projects.
- Maybe typedef std::shared_ptr.
- Don't go overkill on pointers.
- Having a function take in an alias means that you can't declare the variable inside of the function parameter - quite annoying, so maybe don't use aliases for types that are really small anyway like 32 bit integers or something (ie the types that you often just want to declare in the funciton).
- General project structure is really nice - keep to it but maybe the Layer-LayerStack relationship needs readjusting to make things clearer.
